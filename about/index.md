Hello, I’m Andrea, and I love to craft websites with the user experience at the center, which I care about in every detail. Recently I’ve been counting and I realized that I’m a programmer for 30 years\*.

My current job is mainly focused on front-end research and development, working together with tech leaders, training on new technologies / best practices, and technically assess candidates. [More on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/andreaverlicchi)

I’m a father of two, a fan of GitHub, the proud creator of [vanilla-lazyload](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload) and [colonnineelettriche.it](http://www.colonnineelettriche.it/), the writer of [my tech blog](https://www.andreaverlicchi.eu/) and this one. I also occasionally speak at front-end conferences.

I love nature in all of its forms and - when I’m not geeking around - I love cycling, hiking, eat healthy local food, and all kinds of foreign and regional languages and cultures.

\*to be honest, when at 9 I started coding on my MSX, I just copied lines of code from a magazine, but I was loving it. Anyway I have to say thanks to my father for his patience and to the company that included a programming manual for kids (featuring a robot-dog!) in their computers box.
