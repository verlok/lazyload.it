A new website is born!

Here you can find all the techniques and best practices to optimize performance on your websites while preserving SEO.

Let's start with a lazy image.

```html
<img alt="A lazy image" data-src="lazy.jpg" />
```

Add the script tag

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vanilla-lazyload@16.1.0/dist/lazyload.min.js"></script>
```

Then initialize it

```js/0
var lazyLoadInstance = new LazyLoad({
  elements_selector: ".lazy",
  // ... more custom settings?
});
```
